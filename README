= What is Comment+?

This plugin allows several streams of comments on each post, specified by a postmeta value (accessible from the page/post editor) which refers to a set of questions specified by a JSON string in wp_options.

It also includes pagination through comments using AJAH (Asynchronous JavaScript And HTML).

Nomenclature note: On each post, the comments are split into district "streams" defined by the postmeta field. The JSON configuration contains a number of streamsets, which in turn contain a number of streams.

= JSON format

Let's represent it in YAML because it's easier for me to parse, just remember that it should be converted to JSON for PHP to parse:

one-two-three:
- name: Stream1
  fields:
  - name: Are cats cute?
    type: yesno
  - name: What are your favourite crisps?
    type: select
    options:
    - slug: seabrooks
      title: Seabrooks
    - slug: walkers
      title: Walkers
- name: Stream2
  fields:
  - name: Did Tom's quoting test work?
    type: select
    options:
    - slug: y'e's
      title: Y'e's
    - slug: n'o
      title: N'o
- name: Stream3
four-five-six:
- name: Stream4
- name: Stream5
- name: Stream6

The root node is an object, containing named stream sets (arrays). Each stream set contains zero or more streams (objects), which must at least contain a "name" (string). They may also include "fields" (array), which contains zero or more fields to be displayed to the user. The fields have a required "name" (string), and "type" (string - limited to "yesno" or "select"). IF the type is select, the field should also contain "options" (array), which contains objects with a "slug" and a "title" (both strings).


= Installation (end-user perspective)

- Download the plugin
- Put it in wp-content/plugins
- If you downloaded a zip file, unzip it
- Enable it

To define the questions which can appear on each post, the 'commentplus' option should be set (only possible to do manually at the moment). It can also be set by placing it in 'commentplus.json' in the current theme's directory.

For each post that should be commentable, select the appropriate stream set from the Comment+ metabox.


= Integration with a theme (developer perspective)

Replacing the default templates with your own:
- The contents of comments.php can be replaced by adding commentplus_comments.php to your theme
  - This contains what will appear on each page - the comments, and an include of respond.php
- The contents of comments_ajah.php can be replaced by adding commentplus_comments_ajah.php to your theme
  - This contains the comments, for users with JavaScript enabled - the next/prev links are fixed with JS events to bring up the next/prev AJAH
- The contents of respond.php can be replaced by adding commentplus_respond.php to your theme
  - This is the form - mostly standard, with a few fixes to change ids, and a call to $commentplus->render_questions() to display the additional questions

Notes:
- The commenting form is nearly identical to the one in the default theme except that most ids are replaced by classes, and it includes extra questions
- AJAH note: .navigation is removed, and ol.commentlist is replaced by .comments_ajah which comes from comments_ajah.php (via get_comments.php)
- Each stream is collpased using JS and can be opened by activating the links on the headings (clicking, or keyboard-activation)

Things you should have in your theme:
- wp_head() (to load the JS)


= Caveats

- Bugs / unimplemented features
  - There is no UI for modifying the commentplus option
  - Having the comment form move around the page via JS doesn't yet work
  - Currently posts without the _commentplus postmeta field will not have comments
  - This plugin will be very incompatible with WordPress 3 (though I expect the codebase to shrink once the neccessary changes are made - see http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/10910 )
  - "Next" links in the AJAH streams are appropriate for the non-AJAH version
  - When posting a comment, it takes you to the page which would be appropriate if Comment+ was disabled

- These are not bugs, probably
  - If the commentplus_stream POST value is wrong, a comment is posted, but not attached to any stream (though the _commentplus value is not set to the erroneous value)
  - Currently, if the commentplus option is changed, any responses with values that are no longer available have those values silently changed to "No response"
