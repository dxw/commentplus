= What is Comment+?

This plugin allows several streams of comments on each post, specified in that post's postmeta as a JSON array.

It also allows pagination through comments using AJAH (Asynchronous JavaScript And HTML).

Nomenclature note: On each post, the comments are split into district "streams" defined by the postmeta field.


= Installation (end-user perspective)

- Download the plugin
- Put it in wp-content/plugins
- If you downloaded a zip file, unzip it
- Enable it

For each post that should be commentable, add a custom field named _commentplus to any posts that should have multiple streams of comments.
The field must be a JSON array consisting only of strings, for instance ["Can you dig a tunnel to the moon?", "Which is the reddest raddish?"]


= Integration with a theme (developer perspective)

Replacing the default templates with your own:
- The contents of comments.php can be replaced by adding commentplus_comments.php to your theme
- The contents of comments_ajah.php can be replaced by adding commentplus_comments_ajah.php to your theme
- The contents of respond.php can be replaced by adding commentplus_respond.php to your theme

Notes:
- The commenting form is nearly identical to the one in the default theme except that most ids are replaced by classes
- AJAH note: .navigation is removed, and ol.commentlist is replaced by .comments_ajah which comes from get_comments.php
- Each stream is collpased using JS

Things you must have in your theme:
- wp_head() (to load the JS)


= Caveats

- There is no UI for modifying the _commentplus postmeta field
- Having the comment form move around the page via JS doesn't yet work
- Currently posts without the _commentplus postmeta field cannot have comments
- This plugin will not be compatible with WordPress 3 (though I expect the codebase to shrink once the neccessary changes are made - see http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/10910 )
